# Event Countdown Timer

The "Event Countdown Timer" project is a unique application that allows users to create and track countdown timers for various events or occasions. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Event Creation**: Users can input the event name, date, and time to create a countdown timer for a specific event they want to track.
- **Countdown Display**: The application will display the countdown timer dynamically, showing the days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining until the event.
- **Multiple Event Support**: Users can create and manage multiple countdown timers simultaneously, allowing them to track various events at the same time.
- **Responsive Design**: The project will be responsive, ensuring that the application looks and functions well on different devices and screen sizes.
- **Local Storage**: The countdown timers will be stored in the browser's local storage, allowing users to revisit the application and continue tracking their events even after closing the browser.

## Implementation

The project consists of three main components:

- **HTML**: The HTML file provides the structure of the application, including forms for event creation and a section to display countdown timers.
- **CSS**: The CSS file handles the styling and layout of the application, ensuring an attractive and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: The JavaScript file handles the countdown logic, event creation, and local storage functionality. It dynamically updates the countdown timers in real-time.
